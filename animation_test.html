        <h5 id="infotext">The Sun, whose wording comes from the Old and Middle English “sonne” / ”sunne”, is the center of our Solar System, and by far the closest star to Earth. There have been various depictions of the sun throughout ancient history, with some notable depictions being Ra, the sun god in Egyptian mythology, and Amaterasu, the sun god in Shintoism. The Sun is a yellow dwarf and is a type G star. Its heat is immense, with surface temperatures reaching 5,700 C, while the coronal temperature (gas above the surface) can reach up to 1,000,000 C. The Sun is composed of several layers: the corona, the chromosphere, the photosphere, the convection zone, the radiative zone, and the core. As for elemental composition, the Sun is made up of around 38.5% hydrogen, 60% helium, and 1.5% of various heavier elements. Sunlight also contains ultraviolet radiation, which heavily affects many aspects of life. As it houses Earth, it is the only star currently known to house life within its gravitational pull. </h5>
